## MobiStore - React User-Interface 

![MobiStore](/public/logo.png?raw=true "MobiStore")

This is a project for sell and buying phones online all over the world !
The main things used for this project are `React`, `Next.js`, `Redux`, `Material-Ui`, and `Typescript`.

The website is a react recreation of a WordPress Template - [MobiStore - Online Mobile Store](https://easetemplate.com/free-website-templates/mobistore/index.html). While most of the ideas were take from this template the code is 100% written by me.


## About the code

Each page has its own components folder named the same as the page. You will also find the layout page with the footer and header there.
The redux is seperated in its own redux folder that has seperated reducers and actions. In the public folder your will find all the images
that don't change. The styles are located in their own folder each named after the page they style.


## Cloning the code 

First run npm install for the dependencies this project uses and then run it on localhost with npm run dev:

```bash
npm install
# and
npm run dev
```
